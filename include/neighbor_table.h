/* Class : Neighbor_table
 *
 * Provides a neighbor table used to access neighbors of a given site in
 * a lattice. A square lattice is the only available in both 2 and 3 dimensions.
 * Table follows the convention:
 *
 * 2D:
 *      0
 *      |
 *  3 - x - 1
 *      |
 *      2
 *
 * 3D: Do later.
